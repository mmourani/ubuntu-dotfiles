Hi everyone ! this project is to be able to have a copy of my environment on github so I can easily copy the configuration to another server. 

there is a lot of functionalities already taken care of by laravel forge and i will not repeat them, so i will only list here the things I need to do and we can add more functionalities in the future based on specific requirements and servers type.

so the pre-requisite for this to work is to first create a server instance with any provider like amazon. I personally used my own servers for the setup. I will then connect to laravel forge for additional configuration and setup. Once it is all done and clean, I will run the script to copy the environment files. 

My first target is to have: 

1 - this repo properly setup for an ubuntu server and script automatically running on the machine with little or no interaction with the user. 

2 - Oh-my-zsh properly configured on the ubuntu 18.04 machine

3 - get vim configuration setup as well 

4 - get z-zsh for easy access to folders
